# Next-Word-Prediction Model

Developing a Word Predictive system using LSTM

Author: Kula Maganti 

About:
Text generation or specifically next-word prediction, allows users to type with errors and faster. Models such as LSTM and other RNN models are specifically chosen for next-word predictions. LSTM was used in this project to show adequate results and reveal significant loss deduction per epoch. Using this model, the user can generate one word from other previous words.
## Requirements

- Python 3
- numpy
- Matplotlib
- tensorflow
- keras
## Installation

- Clone the project
- Make sure that all the packages requiremnts have been installed 
- This project only has one external library(tensorflow), you only need to install it using the command `!pip install (package_name)` in jupyter notebook cell, just before importing them.
- Make sure the dataset.txt is downloaded
- Then just run run the file and everything should work fine. 

## Model Roadmap 

- Recurrent Neural Networks: LSTM
